          I am a student currently pursing two degrees, Bachelor of Computer
          Science and Masters in Economics. In my free time I develop websites,
          watch movies and listen to too much music (Yup Spotify is better than
          Apple Music).

          So what am I doing here you ask; Let me explain: I have this quirk,
          whenever I discover something new, I have this unbearable tendency to
          call my friends and introduce it to them. And through this process I
          have realized there is some fun in sharing things that you learn and
          discover. It gives this whole process a humane feeling. This is when I
          thought why not start writing about the things that I observe and
          discover everyday.And guess what after much procrastionation in
          setting this blog up, we are finally here!ðŸ˜…
